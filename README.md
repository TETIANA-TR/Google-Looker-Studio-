Introduction to Google Looker Studio
1. Created fields in the report:
Ad Spend Amount

2. Added three charts to the dashboard:
A combo chart with the date the ad was shown on the horizontal axis, and the sum of Ad Spend and ROMI for each month on the two vertical axes.
The horizontal axis is sorted from oldest to newest date.
A line graph with the number of active campaigns in each month of ad serving.
A table with columns and heat maps, where the dimension is the campaign name, and the metrics are total Ad Spend, CPC, CPM, CTR, ROMI.
